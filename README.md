# one-click-doh
A shell script to install a DNS over HTTPS (DoH) server with Chinese-specific configuration, EDNS support, and cache enabled, using [DNS Proxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy) and [dnsmasq-china-list](https://github.com/felixonmars/dnsmasq-china-list).

In theory, it supports CentOS, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu.

To change the default DNS upstreams configuration, please edit /home/dnsproxy/update.sh.
